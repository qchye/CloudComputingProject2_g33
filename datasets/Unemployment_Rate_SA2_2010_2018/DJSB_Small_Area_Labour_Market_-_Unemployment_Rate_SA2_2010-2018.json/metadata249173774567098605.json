The boundaries used for the dataset follow the 2011 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).<br/><br/>\n\nSmall Area Labour Markets presents regional estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at two small area levels:\n<ul>\n<li>For approximately 2,100 Australian Bureau of Statistics??? (ABS) Statistical Area Level 2s (SA2s), on a State/Territory and Metropolitan/Non-metropolitan basis; and</li>\n<li>For each of Australia???s 540 Local Government Areas (LGAs).</li>\n</ul><br/>\n\nThe estimates in Table 1 and 2 are smoothed using a four-quarter average to minimise the variability inherent in small area estimates. A description of the methodology used to prepare the estimates in this publication is presented in the <a href=\"https://www.jobs.gov.au/small-area-labour-markets-publication-explanatory-notes\" target=\"_blank\">Explanatory Notes</a>, as well as on page 43 of the <a href=\"https://docs.jobs.gov.au/documents/small-area-labour-markets-june-quarter-2018\" target=\"_blank\">PDF Publication</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note: \n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the original data.</li>\n<li>Where data values were \"-\" (no data provided) in the original data they have been set to null.</li>\n<li><b>Caution: Highly disaggregated estimates of unemployment and the unemployment rate at the SA2 and LGA level can display significant variability and should be viewed with caution. Indeed, quarter-to-quarter comparisons may not be indicative of actual movements in the labour market. It is therefore recommended that year-on-year comparisons be used.</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"sa2_main11","type":"String","title":"SA2 Code","description":"SA2 Code.","isDimension":false},{"name":"dec_2010","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at December 2010","description":"dec_2010","isDimension":false},{"name":"dec_2011","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at December 2011","description":"dec_2011","isDimension":false},{"name":"dec_2012","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at December 2012","description":"dec_2012","isDimension":false},{"name":"dec_2013","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at December 2013","description":"dec_2013","isDimension":false},{"name":"dec_2014","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at December 2014","description":"dec_2014","isDimension":false},{"name":"dec_2015","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at December 2015","description":"dec_2015","isDimension":false},{"name":"dec_2016","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at December 2016","description":"dec_2016","isDimension":false},{"name":"dec_2017","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at December 2017","description":"dec_2017","isDimension":false},{"name":"jun_2011","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at June 2011","description":"jun_2011","isDimension":false},{"name":"jun_2012","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at June 2012","description":"jun_2012","isDimension":false},{"name":"jun_2013","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at June 2013","description":"jun_2013","isDimension":false},{"name":"jun_2014","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at June 2014","description":"jun_2014","isDimension":false},{"name":"jun_2015","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at June 2015","description":"jun_2015","isDimension":false},{"name":"jun_2016","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at June 2016","description":"jun_2016","isDimension":false},{"name":"jun_2017","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at June 2017","description":"jun_2017","isDimension":false},{"name":"jun_2018","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at June 2018","description":"jun_2018","isDimension":false},{"name":"mar_2011","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at March 2011","description":"mar_2011","isDimension":false},{"name":"mar_2012","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at March 2012","description":"mar_2012","isDimension":false},{"name":"mar_2013","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at March 2013","description":"mar_2013","isDimension":false},{"name":"mar_2014","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at March 2014","description":"mar_2014","isDimension":false},{"name":"mar_2015","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at March 2015","description":"mar_2015","isDimension":false},{"name":"mar_2016","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at March 2016","description":"mar_2016","isDimension":false},{"name":"mar_2017","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at March 2017","description":"mar_2017","isDimension":false},{"name":"mar_2018","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at March 2018","description":"mar_2018","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa2_name11","type":"String","title":"SA2 Name","description":"SA2 Name.","isDimension":false},{"name":"sep_2011","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at September 2011","description":"sep_2011","isDimension":false},{"name":"sep_2012","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at September 2012","description":"sep_2012","isDimension":false},{"name":"sep_2013","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at September 2013","description":"sep_2013","isDimension":false},{"name":"sep_2014","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at September 2014","description":"sep_2014","isDimension":false},{"name":"sep_2015","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at September 2015","description":"sep_2015","isDimension":false},{"name":"sep_2016","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at September 2016","description":"sep_2016","isDimension":false},{"name":"sep_2017","type":"Double","title":"Unemployment Rate at September 2017","description":"sep_2017","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","feature":{"key":"sa2_main11","geoLevel":"sa2","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[140.961681984,-39.159189527500004,149.976679008,-33.9806475865],"featureType":"ste","featureInstance":"2","featureName":"Victoria","referenceSystemIdentifier":"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":["2"]}}
